# Ruby-TicTacToe

Creating the game 'Tic Tac Toe' in Ruby. Authored by Frederico and Gwen

# HOW TO RUN THE GAME

You can run this game by using the following command from the root directory on a command line:
```
ruby bin/main.rb
```

# HOW TO PLAY

When the game starts, an empty Tic Tac Toe board is displayed in the console. 
Each player must decide in which square to place their pieces ('x' or 'o') on the board, using the numbers 1 through 9.
If the square is already taken by another piece, the game will give you an error.
Once a player has a line of 3 pieces on the board, either horizontally, diagonally, or vertically, the game will tell you who wins.
If the board becomes full without any winner, the game will be a draw, and end.
